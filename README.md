# SaaS Support Data Lab – Mini Project

This is a small project showing how I use SQL and relational data to troubleshoot typical SaaS support issues. It includes:

- Users  
- Subscriptions  
- Support tickets  
- Login events  

The data can be explored using SQLite and DB Browser.

A few example SQL queries demonstrate how to:
- Investigate login issues
- View open support tickets
- Connect billing problems to account cancellations

More details and files will be added as the project grows.
