# SaaS Support Data Lab – Mini Project

This project simulates a small SaaS support environment using a relational database and practical SQL troubleshooting techniques. It models real customer scenarios using four simple but realistic tables:

- **users**
- **subscriptions**
- **tickets**
- **login_events**

The goal is to demonstrate how SQL and relational data can help identify issues, verify customer claims, and support clear troubleshooting decisions in a SaaS or technical support role.
